**What is this about?**
Webshop der sælger bøger (ting)

tools and technologies:

**Frontend**
Vanilla js

Why? To not automate security issues, and handle them manually like a real person

**Backend**
Express  js

Why?
We can create routes with express and create our own middleware and authorization functions to show we know what we are talking about 

**Database**
Postgres (med Prisma ??)

Why?
Because we are selling books, the users can search between authors, types of books, titles. So we have relations
